# Process scheduling algorithms

A simulator for basic process scheduling algorithms ([FCFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#First_come,_first_served), [SJF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Priority_scheduling), [SRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Shortest_remaining_time_first), [RR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Round-robin_scheduling))

Outputs average process waiting time.

Simulation runs on predefined number of series of randomly generated (but configurable to some extent) processes.
